/app/ - Contains the controllers, models, views and assets for your application. This is where the majority of the code for your application will live. You will be spending most of your time in this folder!

/public/ - The only folder seen to the world as-is. This is the directory that you have to point your web server to. It contains the bootstrap file index.php which jump-starts the Laravel framework core. The public directory can also be used to hold any publicly accessible static assets such as CSS, Javascript files, images and other files.

/tests/ - Contains automated tests.
